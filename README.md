# Statistical_methods_for_ML
This project aims at the binary classification of a big data set of images that contain cats and
dogs by building a convolutional neural network and studying the impact of network architectures and training parameters on the final predictive performance. Furthermore, computing
the risk estimates by applying the zero-one loss in the cross-validation. This research paper
will study in-deep both the theoretical part of CNN and then describe the data set used and its
processing for this project .The last part will cover the comparison between different implementations applied .
